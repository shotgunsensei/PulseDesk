            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              To use the Service, an organization administrator must register an account and create
              an organization. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information
              during registration and to keep that information updated. You are responsible for

              access for users who are no longer authorized. We are not liable for damages resulting

              The Service is offered on a subscription basis. Plan pricing, features, and billing
              cycles are described on the billing page within the application. Subscriptions
              automatically renew at the end of each billing period unless cancelled before the

              by law or as explicitly stated in these Terms.

              You may upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time. Upgrades take effect immediately
              and are prorated. Downgrades take effect at the start of the next billing cycle.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              If a payment fails, we will attempt to notify you and retry the charge. After a
